# Financial Statements Analysis Quarter 2 2023
In this project I examine open datasets released by the SEC regarding financial statements that were filed to the commissin during the second quarter of 2023. The original data and data for other time periods can be found [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/financial-statement-data-sets). I took these files and uploaded them into a local postgreSQL database. The database was connected to via the programming language R where I could send SQL queries and display the results. I chose to use this approach so that I could create a report using R Markdown which produces an html file. To view the report, please visit [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/TanisAA/Financial-Analysis/c2cb886c5c201f8c37001632363b35b162f55358/src/2023_quarter2_financial_analysis.html). You can also download the html file under the `src` folder and view it locally on your browser of choice. The raw markdown file has also been provided in the same folder.
